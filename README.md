## Introduction

In this project we build a log file monitoring system that sends email alerts to the project stakeholders when any **WARN** or **ERROR** logs are produced by our Log File Generator application.

Our entire project code base is written entirely in Scala and the pipeline is created using the following technology stack:

![Alt text](doc/technologies.jpg?raw=true "Technology Stack")

In the later sections, we will take a detailed look at our code + cloud architecture for this project.

The project comprises 3 Git repositories, each containing their own detailed README files with explanations:

- **Project Component 1: https://github.com/niharjoshi/LogFileGeneratorDeployment.git (current)**
- Project Component 2: https://github.com/niharjoshi/RedisMonitor.git
- Project Component 3: https://github.com/niharjoshi/SparkLogAlertSystem.git

## Prerequisites, Installation & Deployment

**A YouTube video documenting the deployment process can be found here:**

We recommend cloning this repository onto your local machine and running it from the command-line using the interactive build tool **sbt**.

*Note: In order to install sbt, please follow the OS-specific instructions at https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html.*

To clone the repo use:
```console
git clone https://github.com/niharjoshi/LogFileGeneratorDeployment.git
```

Navigate to the repo and use the following command to run the unit test cases:
```console
sbt clean test
```

Next, sbt downloads project dependencies and compiles our Scala classes.
To do this, use the following command:
```console
sbt clean compile
```

To run the log file generator locally, you will need to start a Redis server on localhost.

*Note: In order to install Redis and redis-cli, please follow the instructions at https://redis.io/topics/quickstart*

Next, change the **REDIS_HOST** parameter in the application configuration file at ```src/main/resources/application.conf``` to **localhost**.

To use a cloud-hosted Redis server, follow the same instructions to change your Redis host, but do not forget to add your **base64 encoded AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY** to the application configuration.

Lastly, run the application using:
```console
sbt run
```

### **If you want to run the application over an AWS EKS cluster, follow the steps below:**

First, create a AWS ECR repository to host the application's Docker image (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-create.html). Name the repository **log_file_generator**.

From your terminal, log into using AWS ECR using the following command (replace your account ID and AWS region name accordingly):
```console
aws ecr get-login-password --region your_aws_region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin your_account_id.dkr.ecr.your_aws_region.amazonaws.com

Example
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 824124XXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
```

Next, from the root of the repository, build the Docker image:
```console
docker build -t log_file_generator -f docker/Dockerfile . --platform linux/amd64
```

Once the build is complete, tag the image with the latest tag and the URL of your ECR repository:
```console
docker tag log_file_generator:latest your_account_id.dkr.ecr.your_aws_region.amazonaws.com/log_file_generator:latest

Example
docker tag log_file_generator:latest 824124XXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/log_file_generator:latest
```

Lastly, push the image to the ECR repo:
```console
docker push your_account_id.dkr.ecr.your_aws_region.amazonaws.com/log_file_generator:latest

Example
docker push 824124XXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/log_file_generator:latest
```

*Note: This doumentation assumes that you have kubectl and eksctl set up along with your AWS command line interface. If not, please follow:*
- *kubectl: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/*
- *awscli: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html*
- *awscli IAM auth: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html*
- *eksctl: https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl*

The Kubernetes config for this project is created using a network configuration of 1 VPC and 3 public subnets. You will have to create your own VPC and subnets. Once done, replace the identifiers for networking components in the cluster YAML at ```kubernetes/cluster.yaml```. Example:
```console
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig
metadata:
  name: LogFileGeneratorKubeCluster
  region: us-east-2

vpc:
  id: vpc-b55932de
  cidr: "172.31.0.0/16"
  subnets:
    public:
      us-east-2a:
        id: subnet-5155c63a
      us-east-2b:
        id: subnet-6438f119
      us-east-2c:
        id: subnet-b56c5cf9

nodeGroups:
  - name: EKS-public-workers
    instanceType: t2.medium
    desiredCapacity: 2

```

To create the cluster on AWS, use:
```console
eksctl create cluster -f kubernetes/cluster.yaml
```

This process takes about 20 minutes. Once done, verify is the cluster is created using:
```console
kubectl get svc
```

Next, to deploy the log file generator application to the newly created cluster, edit the ```kubernetes/deployment.yaml``` file and replace the **image** tag with the URI of your ECR Docker image. Example:
```console
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: log-file-generator-deployment
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: log-file-generator
          image: 824124XXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/log_file_generator:latest

```

Before we deploy, please make the configuration changes mentioned in the cloud-hosted Redis section above.

Lastly, to deploy the application onto your Kubernetes cluster, use:
```console
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
```

Verify if logs are being added to your Redis DB. If yes, the deployment is complete.

To see all the written logs, first log into your Redis CLI:
```console
redis-cli
```

To view all the keys:
```console
keys *
```

To retreive a log:
```console
get key
```

## Architecture & Flow of Control

**A YouTube video documenting the detailed architecture and flow of control can be found here:**

### Note: This repository pertains to **Project Component 1**.

![Alt text](doc/flowchart.jpg?raw=true "Flow of Control")

To explain in brief, the core log file generation application is deployed onto a AWS EKS Kubernetes cluster over a deployment of 2 pods (each running one Docker container of the app).

The logs generated by the application are written into an AWS ElastiCache Redis database using a predefined UUID-based key-value schema.

Next, our Akka actor system running on another Kubernetes deployment continuously monitors the Redis DB and looks for newly added logs.

It filters the WARN and ERROR logs our and puts them into a AWS MSK Apache Kafka topic which are then consumed by a AWS EMR Apache Spark cluster with 1 master and 2 slave nodes.

The Spark application batches the consumed logs and subsequently sends email alerts to the project stakeholders.

### **Project Component 1 Design**

When we run the log file generator, our code produces 100 logs at once:
![Alt text](doc/generated-logs.png?raw=true "Generated Logs")

We can verify that the logs have been written to the Redis DB:
![Alt text](doc/logs-in-redis.png?raw=true "Logs In Redis")

We can check the value of a key:
